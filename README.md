# Simple Qt Application

This repository contains a simple Qt application developed using Qt Creator and C++. The application demonstrates basic GUI development using Qt and is intended for educational purposes.

#### Project Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of tasks outlined in the QT Creator and C++ beginner's guide. The tasks are designed to introduce users to QT Creator, C++ programming, and GUI design principles using QT Widgets and QT Designer.

#### Task 1:
In this task, an application is created from scratch using QT Creator and C++. All logic and GUI design, including window size and button placement, are written directly in C code. 


#### Task 2:
This task introduces the use of QT Designer to simplify GUI design. QT Designer allows for graphical placement of widgets and editing of layouts. The layout information is saved in a .ui file, which is used to generate the required C code automatically.
